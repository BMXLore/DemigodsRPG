DemigodsClassic
===============

Demigods Classic! Hybrid of DG2 and DG3.

Overview
========

DG3 was always meant to be the next edition of Demigods, but development limbo has taken control of the project. DG3 is in a nearly playable state, but it isn't fun... yet.

After the whole Bukkit fiasco it became clear we'll be starting over *once again* on DG3 with some new API... and thus DG3 is not gong to be ready or even developed for in the near future (until we know what the landscape is gong to be like and what we want from it).

In the meantime, we've gotten tired of waiting for a fun, new, not buggy version of DG. So, Demigods Classic was born!

Demigods Classic is meant to be a blend of all previous versions of Demigods up until now. Improvements from DG3 are included as well, with some limitations.

The scope is meant to be very similar in feel to DG2, but with active development for new and exciting features with the new backend. Expect more of a simple easy to join in feel than what was planned for DG3.

If it helps, think of this as a total remake of DG2 with the possibility to grow beyond its humble beginnings.

Platforms
=========

Currently, DGC only runs on servers implementng the Bukkit API.  We plan to port over to the new leading API once they have been established (probably Sponge).
